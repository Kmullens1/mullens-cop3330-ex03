        //Printing Quotes
        /*Quotation marks are often used to denote the start and end of a string.
        But sometimes we need to print out the quotation marks themselves by using escape characters.
        Create a program that prompts for a quote and an author. Display the quotation and author
        as shown in the example output.
        Example Output
            What is the quote? These aren't the droids you're looking for.
            Who said it? Obi-Wan Kenobi
            Obi-Wan Kenobi says, "These aren't the droids you're looking for."
        Constraints
            Use a single output statement to produce this output, using appropriate
            string-escapingtechniques for quotes.
            If your language supports string interpolation or string substitution,
            don’t use it for this exercise.Use string concatenation instead.*/
